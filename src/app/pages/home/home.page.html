    <h1>Software built with full ownership, from first decision to long-term operation.</h1>
    <p>
      Duluth Technologies is a senior software team that helps organizations deliver and evolve digital
      products. We lead client projects end-to-end and build our own products with the same
      production standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also work with startups that need seniority to start well, audit their current setup, or fix
      delivery and reliability difficulties already slowing the business.
