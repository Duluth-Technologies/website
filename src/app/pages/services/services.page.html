    <h2>Built for Founders and Early Teams</h2>
    <p>
      Startup environments require fast progress, disciplined trade-offs, and senior technical
      judgment even when budget and team size are constrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      We help founders start projects on solid ground, audit current delivery reality, and recover
      stalled initiatives with a pragmatic execution plan.
    </p>
    <ul class="proof-points">
      <li>Budget-aware scope and roadmap decisions.</li>
      <li>Fast validation cycles with controlled technical risk.</li>
      <li>Clear priorities aligned with product and fundraising pressure.</li>

    <h2>Full Technical Ownership</h2>
    <p>
      We do more than implement tickets. We take end-to-end responsibility for technical direction,
      delivery outcomes, and production readiness. You stay close to business priorities while we own
      the technical path and execution.
